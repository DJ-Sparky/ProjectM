WINDOWS ONLY.

So..  I installed Steam. Then went to the containing folder on my PC and cut the ProjectM folder.

Then I was able to uninstall Steam as I personally have no use for it.. But I found that this meant I could run ProjectM without even having to install it from an external HD...

So Ive zipped it up here for you to use if you wish and added around 11,000 extra Milkdrop files in the presets folder.

F1 for oprtions but remember it is the Steam version so options are limited.
